# n8n Queue Mode Production Template for Coolify

**Deploy production-ready n8n with 15 concurrent workers on Coolify in 15 minutes**

## 📖 Background

I recently published a [comprehensive guide on deploying n8n queue mode with Docker Compose](https://nextgrowth.ai/scaling-n8n-queue-mode-docker-compose/) on a VPS. It works—but it requires manual reverse proxy configuration, SSL certificate management, and healthcheck debugging. **Hours of setup before your first workflow even runs.**

Then I discovered **Coolify could handle all of that automatically.**

Same production-grade queue mode architecture. Same 7x performance improvement. But with **one-click SSL, automatic reverse proxy, and built-in monitoring**—without sacrificing the security hardening and optimization strategies that make it truly production-ready.

This repository contains the battle-tested Docker Compose template that combines Coolify's deployment simplicity with the production configurations from my original guide.

## 🎯 What This Solves

**The Problem:**

❌ **SaaS platforms are expensive:** Pay-per-execution pricing compounds fast. AI workflows with GPT-4/Claude calls hit pricing tiers quickly.  
❌ **Manual Docker is overwhelming:** Reverse proxies, SSL certificates, healthcheck debugging, Redis configuration—hours of work.  
❌ **Existing guides are incomplete:** Most Coolify tutorials skip Redis password protection, execution pruning, and security hardening.  
❌ **No visibility into costs:** Running 40+ AI models without metrics? You're flying blind on API spending.

**This Solution:**

✅ **Production-ready in 15 minutes:** One-click SSL, automatic reverse proxy, container orchestration handled by Coolify.  
✅ **7x performance improvement:** Queue mode with 15 concurrent workers vs single-process execution. ([Official n8n benchmark](https://blog.n8n.io/the-n8n-scalability-benchmark/))  
✅ **Complete security hardening:** Redis password protection, container isolation (`no-new-privileges`), environment variable blocking.  
✅ **AI cost visibility:** Built-in metrics endpoint tracks executions by node type.  
✅ **Database sustainability:** Automatic 14-day execution pruning prevents database bloat.

## 🏗️ Why Coolify for n8n Queue Mode?

### Coolify vs Manual VPS Setup

| Feature | Manual Docker Setup | Coolify + This Template |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Reverse Proxy** | Configure nginx/Traefik manually | ✅ Automatic (built-in) |
| **SSL Certificates** | Manual Let's Encrypt + cron | ✅ Automatic renewal |
| **Setup Time** | 4-6 hours | ✅ 15 minutes |
| **Updates** | Manual image pulls + restart | ✅ One-click in dashboard |
| **Monitoring** | Setup Prometheus/Grafana | ✅ Built-in container stats |
| **Rollback** | Manual container management | ✅ One-click previous deployment |
| **Domain Management** | Manual DNS + config files | ✅ UI-based domain setup |
| **Multi-App Hosting** | Complex nginx configs | ✅ Deploy unlimited apps |

### What You Keep from Manual Setup

This template preserves the **production optimizations** from manual deployments:

- ✅ Redis password protection (missing in default Coolify templates)
- ✅ 14-day execution pruning (prevents database bloat)
- ✅ Metrics endpoint for AI cost tracking
- ✅ Container security hardening (`no-new-privileges`, env blocking)
- ✅ Optimized worker concurrency for your VPS size
- ✅ PostgreSQL required for queue mode (not optional SQLite)

**Best of both worlds:** Coolify's automation + production-grade configuration.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- ✅ Coolify installed on Ubuntu VPS ([Installation Guide](https://coolify.io/docs/installation))
- ✅ Domain with A record pointing to your VPS IP
- ✅ **8GB RAM minimum** (4GB for testing, 16GB+ for high-volume)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 📺 Video Tutorial

[![Watch the tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/snszVmvxTug/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snszVmvxTug)

**[🎬 Watch: Secure n8n Queue Mode with Coolify - Advanced Configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snszVmvxTug)**

### Step 1: Create a New Project in Coolify

1. **Log into your Coolify dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Projects** (left sidebar) → Click **+ Add**
3. **Name your project:**
   - Example: `n8n-automation` or `n8n-production`
4. Click **Continue**

---

### Step 2: Select the n8n Queue Mode Template

1. **On the Resource page**, select your production server → Click **+ Add New Resource**

2. **Search for n8n:**
   - Type `n8n` in the search box to filter services
   - You'll see three n8n deployment options

3. **Choose: "N8N With Postgres And Worker"**
   - ✅ This is the queue mode template with workers pre-configured
   - Description: *"n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool with queue mode and workers"*

**Why this template?**
- Already includes PostgreSQL + Redis + Worker structure
- We'll enhance it with production configurations in the next step

---

### Step 3: Configure Your Domain and Deployment Options

After selecting "N8N With Postgres And Worker," you'll be directed to the Configuration page.

#### 3.1 Configure Your Custom Domain

**Prerequisite:** DNS A record pointing your domain to VPS IP address

1. Click the **Edit** button next to the auto-generated URL
2. Enter your custom domain: `n8n.yourdomain.com`
3. Coolify will automatically:
   - ✅ Configure SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
   - ✅ Set up reverse proxy (Traefik)
   - ✅ Enable HTTPS redirect

---

#### 3.2 Replace with Production Docker Compose

**Critical:** Coolify's default template is good for testing but missing production essentials.

**Copy our battle-tested configuration:**

👉 **[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)** from this repository

**What's enhanced in our template:**

| Feature | Default Template | Our Production Template |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| Redis Password | ❌ No password | ✅ Password-protected |
| Execution Pruning | ❌ Disabled | ✅ 14-day auto-cleanup |
| Metrics | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Full observability |
| Security | ❌ Basic | ✅ Container hardening + env blocking |
| Worker Concurrency | ⚠️ Generic | ✅ Tuned for VPS size |

**Instructions:**

1. **Scroll down** to the Docker Compose editor in Coolify
2. **Select all** existing template code (Ctrl+A)
3. **Delete** and **paste** our production template
4. **⚠️ Do NOT click Deploy yet** - configuration required

---

#### 3.3 Configure Critical Settings

Before deploying, you **must** update these settings or deployment will fail:

<details>
<summary><strong>🔒 Redis Password (CRITICAL - 3 Locations)</strong></summary>

**Why:** Prevents unauthorized access to your workflow queue.

**Generate password:**

```bash
openssl rand -base64 16
# Example output: 6+tzZVrH4gIXtEzQnIbPHw==
```

**Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD` in 3 locations:**

| Location | Line # | What to Find |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **n8n main** | ~92 | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| **n8n worker** | ~227 | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| **Redis command** | ~341 | `- REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD` |

**⚠️ All three MUST be identical** (most common deployment failure)

**Visual guide:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Password:<br/>6+tzZVrH4gIXtEzQnIbPHw==] --> B[Location 1<br/>n8n Main]
    A --> C[Location 2<br/>n8n Worker]
    A --> D[Location 3<br/>Redis Command]
    
    style A fill:#F59E0B
    style B fill:#10B981
    style C fill:#10B981
    style D fill:#10B981
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🌍 Timezone (4 Locations)</strong></summary>

**Why:** Ensures scheduled workflows run at correct times.

**Update in 4 locations**:

```yaml
- GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Asia/Singapore  # ← Change this
- TZ=Asia/Singapore                # ← Must match above
```

**Find your timezone:** [TZ Database List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

**Common examples:**
- US East: `America/New_York`
- US West: `America/Los_Angeles`
- UK: `Europe/London`
- Singapore: `Asia/Singapore`
- Australia: `Australia/Sydney`

**⚠️ Both must match** or scheduled workflows run at wrong times.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ Worker Concurrency (1 Location)</strong></summary>

**Why:** Controls how many workflows run in parallel.

**Adjust based on your VPS**:

| VPS RAM | CPU Cores | Recommended Concurrency |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| 4GB | 2 cores | `5-8` |
| 8GB | 4 cores | `10-15` |
| 16GB | 8 cores | `20-25` |
| 32GB | 16 cores | `30-40` |

```yaml
command: worker --concurrency=15  # ← Change this number
```

**Formula:** `CPU Cores × 2.5` for AI-heavy workflows

</details>

---

#### 3.4 Save Configuration

**Before clicking Deploy, verify:**

- ✅ Redis password replaced in **all 3 locations**
- ✅ Timezone set in **all 4 locations**
- ✅ Worker concurrency adjusted for your VPS

**Click "Save"** in Coolify

---

### Step 4: Deploy and Monitor Logs

#### 4.1 Start Deployment

1. **Click "Deploy"** button (top right in Coolify)
2. Coolify will:
   - Pull Docker images (n8n, PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Create persistent volumes
   - Start all containers
   - Configure internal networking

**Expected deployment time:** 2-3 minutes

---

#### 4.2 Monitor Deployment Progress

**Watch real-time logs** in Coolify's Logs tab.

**Success indicators to look for:**

```
✅ Pulling image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:latest
✅ Container n8n-xxxxxxxx Created
✅ Container n8n-xxxxxxxx Started
✅ Container n8n-worker-xxxxxxxx Started
✅ Container postgresql-xxxxxxxx Started (healthy)
✅ Container redis-xxxxxxxx Started (healthy)
```

**When you see:** `Container n8n-xxxxxxxx Started` → Close the logs window

---

#### 4.3 Verify Container Health

**Check all containers are running:**

```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

**Expected output:**

```
NAMES                STATUS
n8n-xxx              Up (healthy)
n8n-worker-xxx       Up (healthy)
postgresql-xxx       Up (healthy)
redis-xxx            Up (healthy)
```

**✅ All show "Up"** = Deployment successful  
**❌ "Restarting" or "Exited"** = See [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting-common-issues)

---

### Step 5: Verify Production Readiness

A successful deployment is just the starting point. This section validates that **queue mode is actually working** and all components are communicating correctly.

---

### 5.1 Access n8n Interface

**Navigate to your domain:**
```
https://n8n.yourdomain.com
```

**✅ If SSL is working:**
- You'll see a secure connection (padlock icon)
- n8n owner account creation screen appears

**❌ If you see SSL errors:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning
- Check DNS A record points to correct IP
- Verify domain configuration in Coolify

---

#### 5.2 Create Owner Account

**First-time setup screen:**

- **Email:** Your email address
- **Password:** Strong password (20+ characters recommended)
- **First Name / Last Name:** Your details

Click **Continue** to create your account.

**⚠️ This is the admin account** - store credentials securely (password manager)

---

#### 5.3 Verify Queue Mode Active

**Method 1: Check Environment Variable (Quick)**

```bash
docker exec n8n-xxx printenv EXECUTIONS_MODE
```

**Expected:** `queue`  
**If shows `regular`:** Queue mode not enabled (check docker-compose configuration)

---

**Method 2: Check Worker Logs (Detailed)**

```bash
docker logs n8n-worker-xxx --tail 20
```

**Expected output:**

```
✅ n8n worker is now ready
✅ Concurrency: 15
✅ Registered runner "JS Task Runner"
```

**❌ If you see errors:**
```
Error: Redis connection refused
Error: NOAUTH Authentication required
```
→ Redis password mismatch - verify all 3 locations have identical passwords

---

#### 5.4 Test Redis Connection

**Verify worker can communicate with Redis:**

```bash
# Replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your actual Redis password
docker exec redis-xxx redis-cli -a "YOUR_PASSWORD" ping
```

**Expected:** `PONG`  
**If error:** Password mismatch or Redis not running

---

#### 5.5 Test Concurrent Execution

**This validates queue mode is actually distributing work to workers.**

**Create test workflow:**

1. In n8n UI: Click **+ New Workflow**
2. Add **Manual Trigger** node (left panel)
3. Add **Code** node, paste this:

```javascript
const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
await delay(3000); // 3 second delay

return {
  json: {
    message: "Queue mode working!",
    executionId: $execution.id,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
};
```

4. Click **Save** (name it "Queue Mode Test")
5. **Click "Execute Workflow" 15 times rapidly** (as fast as you can click)

**Success criteria:**

✅ **All 15 executions complete in 3-4 seconds total** (parallel processing)  
❌ **Takes 45+ seconds:** Executions running sequentially (queue mode failed)

**What this proves:**

```mermaid
gantt
    title Queue Mode vs Default Mode Execution
    dateFormat X
    axisFormat %S

    section Queue Mode (15 Workers)
    Job 1-15 in parallel  :0, 3

    section Default Mode (Sequential)
    Job 1  :0, 3
    Job 2  :3, 3
    Job 3  :6, 3
    Job 15 :42, 3
```

- ✅ **3-4 seconds:** Workers processing 15 jobs in parallel
- ❌ **45 seconds:** Single-process execution (queue mode not working)

---

#### 5.6 Verify Metrics Endpoint

**Access metrics in browser:**

```
https://n8n.yourdomain.com/metrics
```

**Search for (Ctrl+F):**
```
n8n_workflow_executions_total
```

**Expected result:**
- Page displays Prometheus-format metrics
- `n8n_workflow_executions_total` shows execution counts
- Queue metrics present (`n8n_queue_waiting_jobs`, `n8n_queue_completed_jobs`)

**✅ Metrics visible** = Observability working (ready for AI cost tracking)  
**❌ 404 error** = Metrics not enabled (check `N8N_METRICS=true` in docker-compose)

---

#### 5.7 Production Readiness Checklist

**Before using in production, verify all items:**

- [ ] ✅ All 4 containers show "Up" status
- [ ] ✅ SSL certificate working (https:// with padlock)
- [ ] ✅ Owner account created and accessible
- [ ] ✅ Queue mode active (`EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue`)
- [ ] ✅ Workers show "ready" in logs
- [ ] ✅ Redis connection test returns `PONG`
- [ ] ✅ Concurrent execution test passes (3-4 seconds for 15 jobs)
- [ ] ✅ Metrics endpoint accessible
- [ ] ✅ **Encryption key backed up** (see [Critical Backup](#-critical-backup-encryption-key))

**All items checked?** → Your deployment is **production-ready** 🚀

**Any item failed?** → See [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting-common-issues) below

---

## 🔒 Critical: Backup Encryption Key

**⚠️ DO THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER VERIFICATION**

Your n8n instance uses an auto-generated encryption key to protect all stored credentials (API keys, passwords, OAuth tokens). **If you lose this key, all credentials become permanently unrecoverable.**

### Extract Encryption Key

```bash
docker exec n8n-xxx printenv N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

**Save the output to:**
- ✅ Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass)
- ✅ Encrypted offline backup (encrypted USB drive)
- ✅ Secure company vault/secrets manager

### Why This Matters

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY] --> B[Encrypts All Credentials]
    B --> C[OpenAI API Keys]
    B --> D[Stripe Keys]
    B --> E[AWS Credentials]
    B --> F[OAuth Tokens]
    B --> G[Database Passwords]
    
    H[Lost Key] --> I[❌ ALL Credentials<br/>Permanently Lost]
    I --> J[Cannot Decrypt]
    I --> K[Must Re-enter<br/>Everything Manually]
    
    style A fill:#10B981
    style H fill:#DC2626
    style I fill:#DC2626
```

**If you lose this key:**
- ❌ ALL stored credentials become permanently unrecoverable
- ❌ OpenAI, Stripe, AWS, OAuth tokens cannot be decrypted
- ❌ No recovery method exists
- ❌ Must manually re-enter every credential in every workflow

### Security Best Practices

**Never:**
- ❌ Commit encryption key to git repositories
- ❌ Share via Slack, email, or unencrypted channels
- ❌ Store in plain text files on the server
- ❌ Include in documentation or wiki pages

**Always:**
- ✅ Use a password manager with proper access controls
- ✅ Maintain offline encrypted backup
- ✅ Document where key is stored (not the key itself)
- ✅ Restrict access to authorized personnel only

## Operating this on Coolify: two things that cost real time

Both of these were hit on a live Coolify instance running this stack.

### "Restart" is down-then-up, and the up may not happen

Coolify's **Restart** on a service is not a restart in the Docker sense. It takes the
containers down and brings them back, and the bringing-back can fail silently — the
service is left with no containers at all, and the API reports `degraded:unhealthy`.
Neither **Restart** nor **Start** recovered it; only **Deploy** recreated the
containers.

If you change an environment variable, use **Deploy**, not **Restart**. And check the
queue is idle first:

```bash
docker exec <redis-container> redis-cli llen bull:jobs:wait
docker exec <redis-container> redis-cli llen bull:jobs:active
```

Both zero means nothing is mid-execution and the restart costs nothing.

### Traefik metrics need their own entrypoint, and Coolify's proxy has none

Coolify's own `coolify-proxy` serves `:80` and `:443` and nothing else, so
`--metrics.prometheus=true` alone gives you a metrics endpoint with no way in. Add all
three lines to the proxy configuration (Servers → your server → Proxy), not just the
first:

```
--entrypoints.metrics.address=:8082
--metrics.prometheus=true
--metrics.prometheus.entryPoint=metrics
```

Port 8082 stays on the Docker network and is never published to the host. Restarting
the proxy briefly drops every site on the box, so do it when things are quiet.

This is worth doing early for one reason: request rate is the only series that cannot
be backfilled. Every day without it is a day of traffic history that will never exist.

### If you add your own service behind Coolify's proxy

Do not reference a Traefik middleware that another container defines. Traefik keeps
the HTTP router and **silently drops the HTTPS one**: port 80 redirects correctly,
port 443 hangs with no certificate, and not one line appears in the proxy log. A
container on more than one network also needs `traefik.docker.network` pinned, or the
proxy may pick the network it cannot reach.
